# Gridinit::Jmeter

Tired of using the JMeter GUI or looking at hairy XML files?

This gem lets you write test plans for JMeter in your favourite text editor, and optionally run them on gridinit.com

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gridinit-jmeter

## Usage

A basic test plan

```ruby
require 'gridinit-jmeter'

test do
  random_timer delay: 5000, range: 5000
  threads num_threads: 10, loops: 10 do
    transaction 'Dummy Scenario' do
      visit 'Home Page', 'http://127.0.0.1:4567/' do
        extract 'csrf-token', "content='(.+?)' name='csrf-token'"
      end
   
      submit 'Submit Form', 'http://127.0.0.1:4567/', {
        fill_in: {
          username: 'tim',
          password: 'password',
          'csrf-token' => '${csrf-token}'
        }
      }
    end
  end
end.jmx
```
